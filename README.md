AndroidScreenCast
=================

this project is changed from https://code.google.com/p/androidscreencast
it's on the lisence of Apache Licence 2.0, so you can change it by your ideals.
and the difference is:

  1. no push jar into your phone
  2. no support long time touch
  3. dependent on the adb command "input"
